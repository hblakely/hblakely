ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Hunter Blakely. 

  I've been a fan of technology since 1995, when (at five years old) I saw an email sent for the first time. 
I knew at that moment computers were akin to magic, and I wanted to be a part of that fantastic world.

  In 2003, I had built my first computer (for gaming, obviously) with the help of Free Geek in Portland Oregon. 
Volunteering at Free Geek gave me the opportunity as a young man to recycle e-wasted machines, and to
build systems from viable parts using Red Hat Linux. It was a dream-opportunity for me, as I was living
in a town of 420 residents, far away from the technical world. Gear from all across time would float into
Free Geek, and I became intimately aware of hardware's evolution. From physically dismantaling computer
systems, to testing and cataloging usable parts, then finally assembling and configuring custom chassis,
I had the luxury to explore the mysterious world of computing.

  Naturally, I saught further education on the subject. High school offered a few related courses, which I 
eagerly attended. Later I would pursue higher education in Computer Science at Southern Oregon University (SOU).

  During my time at SOU, I happily worked in the I.T. department, servicing SOU faculty and students alike.
During my 5 years at SOU, I had made my way from I.T. HelpDesk, to Software Deployment, and assisting the 
Sys-Admins in a variety of responsibilities. My favorite task was operating the tape-backup routines.

  After graduating with a Bachelor's of Computer Science Information Assurance from SOU in June 2013, 
I began my career in Software Engineering with Virtual Research Corporation Insurance Systems. 
I had originally planned to get a career in the infosec world, but took a hard-left turn in order to pursue
a love interest ;)

Seven years of full stack engineering alongside VRC's Guru Peter Guy was a unique experience for a 
freshly graduated CS major. 

  Iâ€™m currently refreshing in best practices for Data Structures and time complexity via leetcode.com; and
mathematical challenges via projeceueler.com. In addition to making my code more efficient, I am
practicing with a number of full-stack tools, the newest to me being Docker. 

While I've dabbled with many languages at just about every level of the stack, I'm most comfortable with Java.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that have the potential to make things better for humans.

I'll be updating things as I go, so feel free to follow along if you like.

ToDo: 

-Define what I'm looking for from an employer in 2023
  *remote is almost a must at this point.
  *(mostly)asynchronous would be lovely
  *a good team with mentors and peers
  *a healthy work-life balance
  *benefits
  *pay

-Update and revise resume with appropriate details from 7 years experience.

-Continue refresher courses and share what I've been learning.

-Play with new(to me) technologies and languages like Docker and Go.

-Rewrite and refine LinkedIn profile and self-introduction via this README.md

-Meet and greet with likeminded individuals and companies.
