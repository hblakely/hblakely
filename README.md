- 👋 Hi, I’m @hblakely
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, applying, and sharing. I like solving puzzles, and sharpening my skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning best practices for Data Structures and time complexity via leetcode.com; and
- mathematical challenges via projeceueler.com. In addition to making my code more efficient, I am
- practicing with a number of full-stack tools, the newest to me being Docker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that have the potential to make things better for humans.
