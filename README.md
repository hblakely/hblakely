ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Hunter Blakely. 



-------------------------------------
##### TLDR #####

  With a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and seven years full stack experience, I've seen a few things. 
What I've learned so far is that there is always more to know. While I've dabbled with a variety of languages 
I'm most comfortable with Java, though I am interested in expanding my understanding and tool-sets.

So far this GitHub account is being used to track my (recent) progress with projecteueler.com's math+cs problems,
and leetcode.com's cs interview questions.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that have the potential to make life easier and safer.

##### EARLY YEARS #####

  I've been a fan of technology since 1995, when (at five years old) I saw an email sent for the first time. 
I knew at that moment computers were akin to magic, and I wanted to be a part of that fantastic world.

  In 2003, I had built my first computer with the help of Free Geek in Portland Oregon. 
Volunteering at Free Geek gave me the opportunity as a young man to recycle e-wasted machines, and to
build systems from viable parts using Red Hat Linux. It was a dream-opportunity for me, as I was living
in a town of 420 residents, far away from the technical world. Gear from all across time would float into
Free Geek, and I became intimately aware of hardware's evolution. From physically dismantaling computer
systems, to testing and cataloging usable parts, then finally assembling and configuring custom chassis, 
I had the luxury to explore the mysterious world of computing.

-------------------------------------
#### EDUCATION ####
  Later I would pursue higher education in Computer Science at Southern Oregon University (SOU).
During my time at SOU, I happily worked in the I.T. department, servicing SOU faculty and students alike.
In 5 years at SOU, I had made my way from I.T. HelpDesk, to Software Deployment, and assisting 
the Sys-Admins with a variety of responsibilities. 

-------------------------------------
#### SOFTWARE CAREER ####
  After graduating with a Bachelor's of Computer Science Information Assurance in June 2013, 
I began my career in Software Engineering with Virtual Research Corporation Insurance Systems (VRC). 
Seven years of full stack engineering alongside VRC's Guru Peter Guy was a unique experience for a 
freshly graduated CS major. For the first two years we would meet in-office to collaborate. The 
following five years were spent remotely collaborating. Over a seven year period, our small R&D
team designed a fourth generation language to remove our dependency on a soon-to-be deprecated
language (Oracle's) SQR. ANTLR 4's grammer generation allowed us to create our own language,
and also to translate our codebase to the new V4GL. 

A new language is cool, but without a proper developement environment for that language our developers 
wouldn't be as effective as we'd like. Repurposing WaveMaker's web IDE allowed us to make typie typie 
into clickie clickie, speeding up developement. VRC's insurance system customers could now appreciate
a faster build-time for customer application services.

-------------------------------------
#### HIATUS ####
  Crohn's disease paused my activity with VRC starting April 1, 2021. Since then, a variety of medications
have been tested until we finally found one that worked. With fantastic new medication, and a life-saving
surgery, I have been making a miraculous recovery. Instead of jumping back immediately after experiencing
positive results, I've been taking time to recover fully and get myself back up to speed technologically.

  Iâ€™m currently refreshing in best practices for data structures and time complexity via leetcode.com; and
mathematical challenges via projeceueler.com. In addition to making my code more efficient, I am
practicing with a number of full-stack tools, the newest to me being Docker.

ToDo: 

-Define what I'm looking for from an employer in 2023
  *remote is almost a must at this point.
  *(mostly)asynchronous would be lovely
  *a good team with mentors and peers
  *a healthy work-life balance
  *benefits
  *pay

-Update and revise resume with appropriate details from 7 years experience.

-Continue refresher courses and share what I've been learning.

-Play with new(to me) technologies and languages like Docker and Go.

-Rewrite and refine LinkedIn profile and self-introduction via this README.md

-Meet and greet with likeminded individuals and companies.
