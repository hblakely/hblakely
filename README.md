- 👋 Hi, I’m Hunter Blakely
- 👀 I like solving puzzles, and sharpening my skills. 
- 🌱 I’m currently refreshing in best practices for Data Structures and time complexity via leetcode.com; and
- mathematical challenges via projeceueler.com. In addition to making my code more efficient, I am
- practicing with a number of full-stack tools, the newest to me being Docker.
- While I've dabbled with many languages at just about every level of the stack, I'm most comfortable with Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that have the potential to make things better for humans.
