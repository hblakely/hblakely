ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Hunter Blakely. 



-------------------------------------
##### TLDR #####

  With a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and seven years full stack experience, I've seen a few things. 
What I've learned so far is that there is always more to know. While I've dabbled in a variety of languages, 
I'm most comfortable with Java; though I am interested in expanding my understanding and tool set.

 So far this GitHub account is being used to track my (recent) progress with projecteueler.com's math+cs problems,
and leetcode.com's cs interview questions.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that have the potential to make life easier, safer, and enjoyable.

##### EARLY YEARS #####

  I've been a fan of technology since 1995, when (at five years old) I saw an email sent for the first time. 
I knew at that moment computers were akin to magic, and I wanted to be a part of that fantastic world.

  In 2003 I had built my first computer with the help of Free Geek in Portland Oregon. 
Volunteering at Free Geek gave me the opportunity as a young man to recycle e-wasted machines, and to
build systems from viable parts using Red Hat Linux. It was a dream-opportunity for me, as I was living
in a town of 420 residents, far away from the technical world. Gear from all across time would float into
Free Geek, and I became intimately aware of hardware's evolution. From physically dismantaling computer
systems, to testing and cataloging usable parts, then finally assembling and configuring custom chassis, 
I had the luxury to explore the mysterious world of computing.

-------------------------------------
#### EDUCATION ####
  Later I would pursue higher education in Computer Science at Southern Oregon University (SOU).
During my time at SOU, I happily worked in the I.T. department, servicing SOU faculty and students alike.
In five years at SOU, I had made my way from I.T. HelpDesk, to Software Deployment, and assisting 
the Sys-Admins with a variety of responsibilities. 

  My focus started with an emphasis on Software Engineering, and I took most of the required courses
for such a degree. It was in my fourth year that my interests were shifted towards a security focus.
Digital forensics fascinated me. Both Red and Blue team methodologies were very enticing. The idea
of making a system do what I wanted and not what it was intended to do made me feel alive. Networks,
System Administration, Kali Linux, and DEFCON were all I could think about for quite some time.
Alas, I met a love interest in the last term of my college career, and realized that InfoSec (while
fascinating), may not be the choice for me. Too close to a degree to change course now, I finished
my major but began looking for employment in another sector.

  Addmittedly my mathematical understanding and application wasn't what I would like it to be, and
my knowledge of data structures and algorithms weren't bolstered to the degree of a full-fledged
software engineer graduate. However, being a determined individual, I didn't let that stop me from
searching for employment as an engineer.

-------------------------------------
#### SOFTWARE CAREER ####
  After graduating with a Bachelor's of Computer Science Information Assurance in June 2013, 
I began my career in Software Engineering with Virtual Research Corporation Insurance Systems (VRC). 
Seven years of full stack engineering alongside VRC's Guru Peter Guy was a unique experience for a 
freshly graduated CS major. For the first two years we would meet in-office to collaborate. The 
following five years were spent as remote collegues. 

  Over a seven year period, our small R&D team designed a fourth generation language to remove our 
dependency on a soon-to-be deprecated language, (Oracle's) SQR. ANTLR 4's grammer generation allowed 
us to create our own language, and also to translate our codebase to the new V4GL. This new language 
allowed VRC to continue opperating effectively, maintain security certificates, and also remove dependency 
from Oracle Database - saving us a chunk of change.

  A new language is cool, but without a proper developement environment for that language our team 
wouldn't be as effective as we'd like. Repurposing WaveMaker's web IDE to build software using V4GL allowed 
us to make "typie-typie" into "clickie-clickie", speeding up developement. VRC's insurance system customers 
could now appreciate a faster build-time for custom application services.

 As a member of R&D tasks were often brand new to me. It didn't matter which languages, or which parts of 
the stack were in use, it only mattered that the job got done. In addition to building the tools for 
VRC's developers, it was my duty to assist those same developers in correcting problematic code, and
testing to verify proper functionality. 

-------------------------------------
#### HIATUS ####
  Crohn's disease paused my activity with VRC starting April 1st, 2021. Since then, a variety of medications
have been tested until we finally found one that worked. With fantastic new medication, and a life-saving
surgery, I have been making a miraculous recovery. Instead of jumping back immediately after experiencing
positive results, I've been taking time to recover fully and get myself back up to speed technologically.

  Iâ€™m currently refreshing in best practices for data structures and time complexity via leetcode.com; and
mathematical challenges via projeceueler.com. In addition to making my code more efficient, I am
practicing with a number of full-stack tools, the newest to me being Docker. 

  In 2023 I will jump back into the ever-changing world of Software Engineering, and potentially with a
new team. Until then I'm using my time to build my skills, and to explore new and interesting possibilities
in eemployment.

#### PERSONAL LIFE ####

I've nearly been a cyborg for 19 years now, delving into many aspects of computers and technology
since childhood. I do, however, have a number of interests outside of my techical background.

Rock climbing, snow boarding, karate, yoga, audio engineering, musical performance, cooking, chess, 
and a number of other pass-times have been a part of my life too. I enjoy life, and what it has to offer,
as often as is good to do so; and I look forward to spending time and collaborating with others who do
the same.

#### What I'm looking for from an employer in 2023 ####

  *Remote is almost a must at this point, office as option could be nice.
  
  *(mostly)Asynchronous would be lovely - not strictly required.
  
  *Good team with mentors and peers - I like learning and sharing information.
  
  *Healthy work-life balance - get the job done, avoid burnout.
  
  *Benefits - health, 401k (with match), profit sharing, vacation, sick leave, etc...
  
  *Pay - since the recent economic changes, $90-120k salary seems reasonable.
